 üîç Project Steps

1. Data Cleaning 
   - Handled missing values, incorrect data types, outliers, emoving nulls values, removing low and high cardinality, multicollinearity.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
   - Visualized price trends by area, distribution of apartment sizes.
   
3. Feature Engineering.
   
4. Model Building
   - Trained multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
   - Used RMSE and R¬≤ score for evaluation.

5. Prediction* 
   - Built a pipeline to input house features and predict the price.
